E-Commerce Website Project

Welcome to my E-Commerce Website Project! I built this as part of my capstone challenge to bring together everything I’ve learned about React, Redux, and frontend development. The goal was to create a fully functional e-commerce website that looks and feels like a real online store. I followed a design from a Figma file and worked to make the experience as smooth and engaging as possible.

On the home page, you’ll find a collapsible menu sidebar where users can navigate the site. There’s also a search bar to help users quickly find products they’re looking for. The main section displays a list of products, each with an image, name, price, and an "Add to Cart" button. A cart summary on the side gives users a quick glance at what’s already in their cart without leaving the page.

When you click on a product, you’re taken to the product page. Here, I’ve included more detailed information about the product, like its name, price, category, and a description. You can still add the product to your cart from here if you like what you see.

The cart page is where users can see everything they’ve added so far. I’ve added functionality to adjust the quantity of each item and automatically calculate the total cost. It’s simple and keeps users informed about their shopping.

The checkout page is where users can fill out their shipping and payment information. I’ve built forms to make this easy, and there’s also a final summary of the order so users can review everything before confirming. Once the order is placed, a success page appears to let users know their purchase was completed.

To build this project, I used React for creating the components and interactions. Redux helped manage the state, especially for the cart functionality, and React Router made navigating between pages seamless. I styled everything using CSS to match the design and make it look polished.

Overall, this project was a lot of fun to build. It brings together so many different parts of frontend development into one cohesive application.
